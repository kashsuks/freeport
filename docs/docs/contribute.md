# Contribute

First off, I would like to thank you for considering contributing to Freeport! As a solo dev running this project, it's quite refreshing to see that someone would like to help :D

Before starting off, please take some time to read this projects [Code of Conduct](https://127.0.0.1:8000/code-of-conduct/)

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Freeport is looking for active contribtions (features, bug fixes, documentation, etc) that change the application itself and improve it. The best place to get started is by sifting through the [issues](https://github.com/kashsuks/freeport/issues) tab and searching for something that interests you! Once changes have been made, feel free to open up a pull request and I will try my best to get back you.

Please don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Feel free to reach out to me through kashyap(at)hackclub(dot)help (kashyap@hackclub.help) and I will respond ASAP!
