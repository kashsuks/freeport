# About

Freeport is a TUI (terminal user interface) applications that allows streamlining of data for localhost applications to communicate. 
By using Golang and the bubble ecosystem (bubbletea, bubble, etc) for the creation of the tui.  

The idea was given by a friend (Dodge1) and I decide to work on it for Hack Clubs Flavortown, a program that rewards teenagers for building technical projects and "shipping" them.

I plan on making this project real and making it a great developer tool :)
